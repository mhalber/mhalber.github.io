      <description>Most people are likely familiar with the concept of an average, as we often encouter it in our everyday lives. Questions like: how much money on average do I spend on groceries each week, how much time on average do I spend in front of computer per day, etc., are very common. An average is very simple to calculate - we take some quantities, add them together, and divide the result by the number of the quantities.</description>

      <description>First of all, hello to my new blog :) I&amp;rsquo;ve made a bunch of blog-writing attempts in the past, with a little-to-no success. So let&amp;rsquo;s hope this time it works out!
In this short article, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe a neat little function that allows you to have a gradient backgrounds in your OpenGL applications, like the snazzy 3D apps (Blender pictured below) do these days.
Our goal is to create a single function, working very much like the glClearColor, but rather than a single color it should be to accept arguments for colors at the top and bottom of the window.</description>
